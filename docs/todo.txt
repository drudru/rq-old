- Simple sections for web view
- Implement logging for jobs (duration)
- Implement job monitoring so web can get real-time status
- 'chain' end state
- Move web, scandir, timer, etc. to separate dir
- Possibly record all jobs started (for a master queue or workflow trace)
- Make scandir and timer separate systems that 'exec' vs fork
- Move to rq2 protocol
- Move to separate logger system (separate process)
- Make web use a component type model (each system responsible for its own ui)
- Fix relay script - only does remote delivery
