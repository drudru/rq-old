# RQ

RQ is a **simple** reliable queueing/messaging system for *any* Unix system. It can process messages sent to queues in **any computer language** that runs on Unix (scheme, lisp, ruby, bash, etc.) It is designed to run on every machine
in your distributed system. Think of it as another one of those small, but
important services (like crond). It uses directories and json text files on the
Unix filesystem as its database. As a result, it is easy to understand and debug.

RQ also has a simple periodic timer process that will inject a predefined
message into a queue.

**Note** - this version of rq is a branch off of brightroll/rq and is not following that branch.
This branch requires Ruby 2.0 and higher and has a slightly different API.

## Concepts
Each item in the queue is a **Message**. Messages can be small, but RQ was
designed for a medium to large granularity. For example, messages could have
attachments with 100s to 1000s of megabytes. Each message can be processed by
a local or remote queue. There is a special queue that relays messages reliably to another machine for processing. These
machines don't have to be in the same data center and in fact can be on another
continent. When a message is received in a queue, a worker process is started
to ingest the message. The worker process is one-to-one with a unix process.
(some call this a 'forking' model). The code required to implement a worker process is very small.
This is known as the worker API. If your favorite language runs on Unix, then it can easily implement the API. While
a worker is processing a message, a real-time display of the workers output
(with ANSI colors) can be viewed in a web browser.

Here is a sample screenshot of a single queue:

## A brief overview of the system.
To use RQ just install it and create a 'queue'. The queue requires only a few
parameters, but the most important one is the 'queue script'. This is a program
written in *any* language that will process each message. The API for the queue
script is easy to implement and is described below. Whenever a message is received
on that queue, this program runs. The program will either succeed, fail, or ask
to retry *x* seconds in the future. If the script takes a long time to run, it
can send periodic updates to RQ to indicate progress. The script is encouraged
to generate logs. It is also ok for the script to generate new files as output.

The RQ system provides a REST, HTML, cmd-line, or low-level socket API to work
with messages and queues. That is all there is to it.

When would you use RQ?
In a typical web application, you should always respond to the browser within a
small time frame. If the users request will consume a lot of time and space
(CPU and Memory), then it is probably best to hand off the request to a queueing
system like RQ. Once you do that, you will receive an 'id' for the message in the
queue. You can store that in the users session and provide them periodic updates
on the status of that process.

If you have scripts that run under cron, you should probably run that under RQ.
RQ will monitor that the script properly executed, and never fails silently.

Here are some examples:

* Transcoding a video file (high cpu)
* Implement a large query for a user in the background
* Have a queue for curl requests for URLs passed in
* A processing pipeline for files stored in S3 (a lightweight map/reduce)
  * retrieve
  * filter
  * reduce
  * sftp result to destination
* Deploy an update to systems all over the world for user-facing web app (high latency)
* Periodically rotate and send HTTP logs to a NoSQL database for search and analysis
* Verify URLs with Internet Explorer (and take screenshots) on a box controllable via a simple web api
* Spin up EC2 instances via AWS API

<a name='section_Quick_Setup'></a>
## Quick Setup

1. Clone this git repository
1. Run `./bin/rq-install` to create a config and a set of default queues.
1. Run `./bin/rq-mgr start` to start the rq-mgr process, one RQ process per queue, and the web interface.
1. Run `./test/run_tests.sh` to exercise the test suite.

An init style startup script is provided in `bin/rc.rq`, you may copy or symlink it to your system init directory.

RQ returns a complete HTTP URL for each enqueued message, therefore you must configure RQ with the canonical hostname for real-world use.

## Features

<a name='section_Hip_Tips'></a>
## Hip Tips

* Scripts should be idempotent if at all possible.
* Messages should not go to error frequently
  * RQ can retry a message if the error is transient. If this is happening, something is wrong with your assumptions.
* Generate log output that might help others diagnose issues
* Crypto - sign and encrypt your message before giving it to RQ. It is too hard to create strong, multi-point, secure channels.
* Use the status system to send progress updates for long running scripts
* Do not run RQ in production with the name 'localhost'

<a name='section_Config_Files'></a>
## Config Files

At the top level, `config/config.json` provides primary configuration. A typical
config:

config.json
``` json
{"env":"development","host":"127.0.0.1","port":"3333","addr":"0.0.0.0","tmpdir":"/tmp",
 "relative_root":"/therq",
 "basic_auth":{
  "realm":"Your RQ",
  "users":{
   "foo user":"bar pass"
} } }
```

Key                   | Description
:--                   | :----------
**env**               | Environment for RQ_ENV
**host**              | Hostname used for canonical full message ID
**port**              | Port for the web UI to listen on (required, but default is 3333)
**addr**              | Addr for the web UI to listen on (0.0.0.0 for all interfaces)
**tmpdir**            | Directory for temp files
allow_new_queue       | Boolean, enable the new queue web UI, default `false`
relative_root         | Path prefix for the web UI, default `/`
basic_auth            | Hash for HTTP Basic authentication, has two required elements
basic_auth: **realm** | Realm for HTTP Basic
basic_auth: **users** | Hash of username:password pairs

_Fields in **bold** are mandatory, all others are optional._

<a name='section_Queue_Config_Files'></a>
## Queue Config Files

Within each queue directory, the files `config.json` and `form.json` provide
configuration.

In order to create a queue, there is now a 'scandir' mechanism similar to daemontools services. Simply create a symbolic link the directory that contains the queue-script files in the /rq/scandir directory. RQ will notice the new directory and create a queue with the same name as the symlink. The name must be a valid queue name and the directory must have a 'run' file that is executable.

Before the newly created queue is enabled, the queue will create a config.
If the queue-script directory also had a config.json, those settings will be
overlayed over the default queue config.json settings. The queue's config.json
will point to the actual path of the 'run' file. Finally, a symbolic link to the
form.json is created in the queue directory as well.

If the symlink is removed, the queue is disabled and moved to a 'trash' directory. No files would be lost.


Sample configs:

config.json
``` json
{"name":"interval_do_work","script":"/usr/bin/interval_script.sh","num_workers":5}
```
form.json
``` json
{"default":"hidden","mesg_param1":{"label":"Frequency of run","help":"Tell the script its run interval"}}
```

Key                  | Description
:--                  | :----------
**name**             | Name of the queue
**script**           | Path to the script to execute for each message
num_workers          | Maximum number of messages to process at a time, default `1`
exec_prefix          | This is prepended to the script path before calling `exec()`, default `bash -lc`
env_vars             | Hash of environment variables and values set before calling `exec()`, default empty
coalesce_params      | Array of param numbers. Coalesce messages if they have identical parameters, default []
blocking_params      | Array of param numbers. Run one message with identical parameters at a time, default []

_Fields in **bold** are mandatory, all others are optional._

Scheduled jobs may be queued up to 1 minute in advance, with a `due` time set to
match the scheduled time. Scheduled jobs will only be created if the queue is in
`UP` state - a paused or downed queue will not schedule new jobs. Multiple
schedules are supported and each can have different params.

<a name='section_Timer_Config_Files'></a>
## Timer Config Files

RQ supports sending a message to a queue on a periodic basis. This is useful
for polling other services or performing periodic cleanup. It is recommended that
the interval is not less than 300 seconds.

In order to create a timer, there is now a 'scandir' mechanism similar to daemontools services. Simply create a symbolic link to the timer json file in the
 /rq/timers directory. RQ will notice the new file and create a timer with the same name as the symlink. The name must be a file with a single '.' character used for the
 suffix  '.json'.

The timers daemon keeps an in-memory database of all the timers.

Once the timer is created, it is immediately run.

If the file is modified, the new information will override the prior in-memory timer.

If the symlink is removed, the timer is removed from the in-memory database.


Sample timer.json:

``` json
{
  "period" : 86400,
  "msg" :
  {
    "dest" : "cleaner"
  }
}

```

Key                  | Description
:--                  | :----------
**period**           | Number of seconds for the period. Minimum must be >= 60
**msg**              | JSON object that represents the message to be sent
**dest**             | String representing the destination queue name
param1               | String representing Param1
param2               | String representing Param2
param3               | String representing Param3
param4               | String representing Param4

_Fields in **bold** are mandatory, all others are optional._


<a name='section_Guarantees'></a>
## Guarantees

* Messages cannot be guaranteed to be delivered in order
* Messages are unique per machine and should use the unique host name
* Messages can be guaranteed to be delivered intact when relayed (MD5)
* RQ will not respond with an OK if a message cannot be commited to disk
* Queue Scripts that are referenced via symlinks are resolved to their full path before execution
  * (This is especially helpful when you have scripts running and you deploy a new version)
* Files are consistent

It *tries* very hard to:

- insure the message processing environment is in an identical state every run

- avoid duplicate messages
  aka - there is a small chance that messages might be duplicated.

It *does not try* hard to guarantee ordering
  - messages might come in out-of-order. this may happen as a result
    of a failure in the system or operations repointing traffic
    to another rq

given the above, use timestamp versioning to insure an older message
doesn't over-write a newer message. if you see the same timestamp again
for a previously successful txn, it might be that ultra-ultra rare duplicate,
so drop it.

- You must exit properly with the proper handshake.

<a name='section_Queue_Script_API'></a>
## Queue Script API

<a name='section_Environment'></a>
### Process Environment

When a queue has a message to process, the
queue script will be executed in a particular environment for that
message. This environment
passes information about the message to the script via the two ancient forms of
Interprocess Communication: environment variables and the filesystem.
The environment will also have certain file descriptors set up for the queue-script.

Full Msg ID = host + q_name + msg_id

**Environment Variables**

Variable        | Description
:-------        | :----------
RQ_SCRIPT       | The script as is defined in config file
RQ_REALSCRIPT   | The fully realized path (symbolic links followed, etc)
RQ_HOST         | Base URL of host (Ex. "http://localhost:3333/")
RQ_DEST         | Msg Dest Queue (Ex. http://localhost:3333/q/test/)
RQ_DEST_QUEUE   | Just Queue Name (Ex. 'test')
RQ_MSG_ID       | Short msg id (Ex. "20091109.0558.57.780")
RQ_FULL_MSG_ID  | Full msg id of message being processed (Ex. http://rq.example.com:3333/q/test/20091109.0558.57.780)
RQ_MSG_DIR      | Dir for msg (Should be Current Dir unless dir is changed by script)
RQ_READ         | Read side pipe FD to the Queue management process
RQ_WRITE        | Write side pipe FD to the Queue management process
RQ_COUNT        | Number of times message has been relayed or processed
RQ_PARAM1       | param1 for message
RQ_PARAM2       | param2 for message
RQ_PARAM3       | param3 for message
RQ_PARAM4       | param4 for message
RQ_FORCE_REMOTE | Force remote flag
RQ_PORT         | port number for RQ web server, default = 3333
RQ_ENV          | Typically one of 'production', 'development', or 'test'
RQ_VER          | RQ version

**File Descriptors**

Descriptor      | Name            | Description
:-------        | :-------        | :----------
0               | stdin           | Any attempt to read this will return EOF.
1               | stdout          |
2               | stderr          |
3               | RQ_WRITE        | Used to communicate to queue daemon
4               | RQ_READ         | Used to receive data from queue daemon


**Filesystem**

Current Dir = [que]/[state]/[short msg id]/job/

Stdio and Stderr are redirected to a file called stdio.log in the current dir.
The stdio.log file can be viewed and 'tailed' in the web ui.

The system also supports 'attachments'. They are in the following directory:

[que]/[state]/[short msg id]/attach/

Attachments can be stored with the message when the message is being created for a queue. They are relayed with the message when it goes to any other queues for
processing.

<a name='section_Pipe_Protocol'></a>
### Pipe Protocol

A queue script communicates with its parent RQ process over a pair of pipes.
The pipe file descriptor numbers are provided in the RQ_READ and RQ_WRITE
environment variables, named from the perspective of the queue script.

The queue script's stdin is closed, and its stdout and stderr are redirected to a file.

The queue script protocol follows this grammar:

```
CMD Space Text Newline
CMD = run | done | err | relayed | RESEND | DUP

resend detail:
  RESEND     = resend DUE Dash Text
  DUE        = Integer

dup detail:
  DUP        = due Dash FUTUREFLAG Dash NEWDEST
  DUE        = Integer
  FUTUREFLAG = X
  NEWDEST    = An RQ queue path

dup response:
  STATUS Space CONTENT
  STATUS     = ok | fail
  CONTENT    = for ok: <new message id> | for fail: <failure reason text>
```

For obvious reasons, the Text cannot have any newline characters. There is no
limit to Text length, but in practice it should not exceed a few hundred bytes.

Command | Description
:------ | :----------
run     | When the script is running, it is in 'run'. To send an updated status to the operator about the operation of the script, just send a 'run' with TEXT as the status.
        | example: `run Processed 5 of 15 log files.<nl>`
done    | When the script is finished, and has successfully performed its processing. It sends this response. It *must* also exit with a 0 status or it will go to 'err'.
        | example: `done Script is done.<nl>`
err     | When the script has failed, and we want to message to go to 'err' (probably to notify someone that something has gone wrong and needs operator attention). Any exit status at this point will take the message to 'err'.
        | example: `err Database dump script failed.<nl>`
relayed | This should only be set by the relay queue. It indicates that the message was relayed and provides the new url.
resend  | When the script has failed, but we want to just retry running it again, we respond with a 'resend'. This will cause a message to go back into 'que' with a due time of X seconds into the future.
        | example: `resend 300-Memcached at foo.example.com not responding.<nl>`
dup     | Clone the existing message (including attachments) to NEWDEST. NOTE: This is the first status response that is a 2 way conversation with the queue daemon. In order to know if the task succeeded, a response must be read. If the NEWDEST matches /^https?:/, then it goes to 'relay' to be sent on. Otherwise it is considered a local. If relay or the local queue doesn't exist or is admin DOWN/PAUSE, then the the response will indicate failure. This resets the current count for the newly generated message.
        | example: `dup 0-X-http://rq.example.com/q/queuename<nl>`


Additional notes on 'dup'. The original idea was to add a very general mechanism for a script to clone itself to another queue. It may continue doing additional work. However, this feature was rarely used as it puts additional burdens on the queue script writer to read the result and take the appropriate action.

The more typical case is that the script is effectively done and it just needs to forward a copy of itself to another queue in the system. We should introduce a new
command that doesn't require the two-way communication. Its goal is to treat this
as a done message. If the system fails to queue the message, then just go to error.
The only reason a queue would not accept a message was if it was not local. Also,
the clone process should use hardlinks on the attachments to avoid copying them.


<a name='section_Special_Queues'></a>
## Special Queues

* `cleaner` - this queue's script periodically removes old messages.
* `relay` - this queue's script sends messages to a separate system. Whenever RQ
  locally is given a message that is destined for a separate host, the message
  actually goes into this queue.
* `webhook` - this queue's script does webhook notifications for any message
  that requests it.

<a name='section_Internals'></a>
## Internals

We use Unix Domain Sockets for the primary RPC mechanism. They work just like
TCP sockets, except we don't have to worry about network security. You
rendezvous with the listening process via a special file on the filesystem.
Also, they are better than pipes since they provide 2 way communication.

There are 3 primary systems that make up RQ. The rq-mgr process, the individual
rq queue processes, and the web server process.

The primary process is the rq-mgr process. It sets up a Unix Domain socket and
communicates via that for its primary API. Its primary function is to watch
over and restart the individual RQ *queue* processes. It maintains a standard
Unix pipe to the child RQ process to detect child death.

Each queue gets its own process. They also communicate. These monitor their
queue directories and worker processes. They have the state of the 'que' queue
in memory. It also uses a standard unix pipe to communicate with the rq-mgr.
For queue scripts it maintains.

The web server exists to give RQ a human (HTML) and non-human (REST) interface
using the HTTP standard. This makes it easy to use via a browser, cURL, or with
just about any HTTP lib that comes with any language.

The overall concepts are very similar to the original UUCP systems that used to span the internet.

The idea for the directory storage was copied from the Qmail architecture by Dan J. Bernstein.

The code for RQ was largely written in-house.

Thanks to the BrightRoll engineers who used the system to help work the bugs out.

http://github.com/TJeezy is largely responsible for making RQ look a lot better.

I looked to resque for inspiration for this documentation.
I treat it as a goal that I still want to achieve.
